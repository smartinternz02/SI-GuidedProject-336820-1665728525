Machine Learning based Smart Home – Temperature Prediction using IBM Watson Studio
A smart home's devices are connected with each other and can be accessed through one central point like a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or game console. 
Door locks, televisions, thermostats, home monitors, cameras, lights, and even appliances such as the refrigerator can be controlled through one home automation system
Smart Wi-Fi thermostats have moved well beyond the function they were originally designed for controlling heating and cooling comfort in buildings.
They are now also learning from occupant behaviours and permit occupants to control their comfort remotely. 
Thermal comfort in buildings has been managed for many years by thermostats. At a most basic level, a thermostat allows a resident to set a desired indoor temperature,
a means to sense actual temperature within the thermostat housing, and a means to signal the heating and/or cooling devices to turn on or off in order to affect
control of the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in order to equilibrate the room temperature to the set point temperature. 
Thermostats use sensors such as thermistors or thermal diodes to measure temperature, they also often include humidity sensors for measuring
humidity and microprocessor-based circuitry to control the HVAC system and operate based upon user-defined set point schedules.
This project seeks to go beyond this state of the art by utilizing smart Wi-Fi thermostat data in residences to develop dynamic predictive models 
for room temperature and cooling/heating demand. 
While efforts are being made around the world to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and make progress towards a more sustainable society, global energy demand
continues to rise. Building energy consumption accounts for 20–40% of the total global energy consumption and Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC)
answer for around 50% of this amount. Therefore, implementing energy efficiency-related strategies and optimization techniques in buildings is a critical step
in reducing global energy consumption.
